  <p class="title"><b>Evaluating tax harmonization policy in the European Union</b>, with Kathleen Hu</p>
  <blockquote>We examine the reallocation of jobs within the EU that would occur under a uniform corporate tax rate. Currently, member states independently set their corporate taxes, but they are still integrated through the area's free trade regime. Given this policy combination, low-tax countries are attractive locations for production since output could later be shipped tariff-free to destination markets. As a result, low-tax countries may attract extra jobs. However, member states with low taxes also tend to be less productive, creating the narrative that they rely on low taxes to "poach" these jobs from other countries. In response, high-tax countries like Germany and France have pushed for an EU-wide corporate tax harmonization. Using a structural spatial model estimated with EU aggregate data, we quantify the effects of this reform.</blockquote>

  <p class="title"><b><a href="http://github.com/rowanxshi/cdc_solver/blob/master/algorithm.pdf">Quickly optimizing over a lattice</a></b></p>
  <blockquote>In general, choosing the optimal subset from a set of items is computationally difficult. However, these problems are common in economics: for example, a firm may face the decision of which countries to export goods. In this case, the firm must choose any number of countries among all international countries. In richer models with firm heterogeneity, the optimal set may change based on the firm's characteristics. I develop a quick and robust algorithm grounded in theory to compute the mapping from firm characteristic to optimal set, applicable to a wide range of scenarios considered in international trade. In time trials, it is around 10x faster than existing methods.</blockquote>

  <p class="title"><b>Brazil's tariff cuts and jobs in its nontraded sector</b></p>
  <blockquote>I uncover novel impacts of tariff cuts on nontraded industries such as education or legal services. Recent trade literature has established that import competition causes increased concentration in <i>traded</i> industries (like manufacturing), with large establishments growing at the expense of smaller ones. I show that the same effect is borne out in the <i>nontraded</i> sector in reaction to Brazil's dramatic tariff cuts during the 1990s. On net, the nontraded sector ended up with around 1 million more jobs. There is a positive effect despite contraction of small establishments because large establishment expansion more than compensated.</blockquote>

  <p class="title"><b><a href="http://github.com/rowanxshi/rural_education/blob/master/summary.pdf">Does early education increase rural-to-urban mobility?</a></b></p>
  <blockquote>Conventional wisdom asserts that education is a valuable pathway to opportunity and upward social mobility. Using Honduras census data, I explore the relationship between childhood schooling and adult likelihood of living in an urban area. The analysis centers on this outcome since quality of life is better in urban areas by many measures, including income. I find that each additional year spent in school increases this likelihood by 5-11 percentage points. Those born in more rural areas receive the larger benefit from education. This result suggests a role for strong education policy.</blockquote>
