  <li>strong statistical and technical skills, especially in causal inference methods, quantitative computing, mathematical modelling, and using large administrative micro-datasets</li>
  <li>experienced communicator, from writing reports of all lengths, presenting research, and teaching classes</li>
  <li>enthusiastic collaborator, enjoying team or partner projects such as co-authored papers</li>
  <li>detail-oriented and organized, from self-directing projects and serving as a large lecture course organizer</li></ul>

  <div class=section><h2>Education</h2></div>
  <div class=dates>2020</div><p class=desc><b>PhD (expected) in Economics</b>, <i>Princeton University</i></p>

  <div class=section><h2>Research Projects</h2></div>
  <div class=dates>2016 - </div>
  <p><b>Evaluating tax harmonization policy in the European Union</b>, <i>collaborative project</i></p>
    <ul><li>predicted inequality effects of tax reform using mathematical simulation modelling (structural general equilibrium)</li>
    <li>fit the spatial model to data on EU corporate taxes, national expenditure, and other aggregate variables</li>
    <li>wrote, deployed, and supervised distributed (parallelized) computational code on 16-core remote cluster in Julia</li></ul>
  <div class=dates>2018 - 2019</div>
    <p><b>An algorithm for fast optimization over a lattice</b>, <i>independent project</i><p>
    <ul><li>slashed computational time by 10-100x by designing and implementing new algorithm in Julia</li>
    <li>wrote documentation and gave presentations with usage demonstrations</li>
    <li>theoretically proved the algorithm is always accurate and applicable in many relevant settings</li></ul>
  <div class=dates>2017 - </div>
    <p><b>Brazil's tariff cuts and jobs in its nontraded sector</b>, <i>independent project</i></p>
    <ul><li>operationalized 10 years of worker panel administrative datasets (500M+ obs) for analysis</li>
    <li>concluded that Brazil's tariff cuts created ~1M jobs in nontraded (service) industries, using causal inference strategy incorporating binary outcome and selection correction analysis in R</li>
    <li>gave seminar presentations of findings</li></ul>
  <div class=dates>2019</div>
    <p><b>Does education increase rural-to-urban mobility?</b>, <i>independent project</i></p>
    <ul><li>merged 3 years of spatial Honduras census data (IPUMS)</li>
    <li>designed and completed instrumental variable causal analysis of school's role on adult outcomes in R</li>
    <li>concluded that each year of early education causes a 5-11 p.p. higher likelihood of living in a city as an adult</li>
    <li>wrote report for general audiences, describing quasi-experimental design and results using R markdown and gglot2</li></ul>

<!-- I am interested in the research analyst positions at Givewell: the organization's goals appeal to me since I would like to make a positive social impact with my work, and the research analyst positions are aligned with my skillset. As a sixth-year PhD student in economics at Princeton University, my own research projects rely on extracting causal conclusions from observational data. The self-directed nature of research has developed my ability to manage my projects and time, while regular presentations have taught me to communicate my findings clearly and succinctly. I am excited to apply these skills in an environment where the projects are challenging, meaningful, and have direct measurable effects. -->
